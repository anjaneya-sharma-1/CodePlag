## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

#### 1. Code Preprocessing

Before applying similarity detection algorithms, the code goes through several preprocessing steps:

1. **Tokenization**
   - Converts source code into tokens
   - Removes comments, whitespace, and formatting
   - Normalizes variable names and string literals

2. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Generation**
   - Parses the code into an AST representation
   - Captures structural similarities regardless of formatting
   - Enables detection of renamed variables and functions

#### 2. K-Shingling

The k-shingling algorithm breaks down the preprocessed code into overlapping k-length sequences:

```cpp
// Example of k-shingling with k=5
Original: int main() { return 0; }
Shingles: 
- "int m"
- "nt ma"
- "t mai"
- " main"
- "main("
...
```

Implementation characteristics:
- Uses rolling hash for efficient shingle generation
- Optimal k-value determined through empirical testing
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is code length

#### 3. MinHashing

MinHash algorithm reduces the dimensionality of shingle sets while preserving similarity:

1. **Hash Generation**
   - Applies multiple hash functions to each shingle
   - Typically uses 100-200 hash functions
   - Uses consistent hashing for reproducibility

2. **Signature Matrix**
   - Creates compressed representation of document
   - Maintains similarity properties
   - Reduces space complexity significantly

Time Complexity: O(nh) where n is number of shingles and h is number of hash functions

#### 4. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

LSH is used to efficiently find candidate pairs for detailed comparison:

- Divides signature matrix into bands
- Uses multiple hash tables to improve accuracy
- Reduces comparison complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n)

#### 5. Jaccard Similarity Calculation

Final similarity score is computed using Jaccard similarity:

```
J(A,B) = |A ‚à© B| / |A ‚à™ B|
```

Where A and B are the sets of shingles from two documents.

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multi-threaded shingle generation
   - Concurrent hash computations
   - Distributed LSH when available

2. **Memory Management**
   - Efficient shingle storage using bit arrays
   - Stream processing for large files
   - Memory-mapped file operations

3. **Cache Optimization**
   - LRU cache for frequent comparisons
   - Memoization of hash values
   - Optimized data structures for locality

### Data Structures

1. **Bloom Filters**
   - Used for quick similarity checking
   - Reduces false positives
   - Space-efficient set representation

2. **Min-Heap**
   - Maintains top-k similar documents
   - Efficient updates during processing
   - O(log n) insertion and deletion

3. **Trie**
   - Efficient storage of common code patterns
   - Quick prefix matching
   - Reduces memory usage for similar code segments

## Time Complexity Analysis

Overall system complexity breakdown:

1. Preprocessing: O(n)
2. Shingling: O(n)
3. MinHashing: O(nh)
4. LSH: O(b * r) where b = bands, r = rows per band
5. Jaccard Similarity: O(m) where m = signature size

Total complexity: O(n + nh + b*r + m)

## Space Complexity Analysis

- Document Storage: O(n)
- Signature Matrix: O(n * h)
- LSH Tables: O(n * b)
- Working Memory: O(k) where k = batch size
